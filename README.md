# PuzzleGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Done:
Configured vscode for unreal engine following this tutorial: https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-code-for-unreal-engine/

TODO for 26/01/2023
- Fix the low performance bug (probably because of the lerp method)
- Study the best way to implement the Rewind function:
  - it could be by using timeline so it will always take the same amount of time to Rewind; 
  - it could be without time ine so it will take the same amount of time that was taken in the original movement
