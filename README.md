Developed with Unreal Engine 5

TODO for 24/01/2023

Start to implement the real stuff for the rewind time feature:
  - There are two arrays created, one for location and one for rotation
  - Check if the current position and rotation are different of the last index
  - if it's true, add this location and rotation to the arrays
